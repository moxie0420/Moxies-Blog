# Continuing the setup

If you haven't Read the [first part](/posts/2024-06-30-obs-studio/) I would suggest you take a quick peek.

## Vtubing

In order to use my vtuber model i needed to setup a tool called VSeeFace,
thankfully this can be done via lutris.
Once Installed and launched you can select an avatar or import one.
