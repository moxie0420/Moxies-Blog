# Blogs

## we have all tried them

Whether it was that blog you made in middle school or a random side project most of us have made a blog.
When I first made one it was a throwaway for a school project. It had no meaning to me and was forgotten.

## Then why does this exist?

I'm making this blog in the hopes of improving myself as a person.
I hope to document my projects here and use this blog as a means of motivation.
But I also want to make this a place where I can share my interest, whether it's a new piece of technology
or just something new to me.

# This website

## The Beginnings

this is my first project using Astro so I used a template made by [ttomczak3](https://github.com/ttomczak3)
. The [Milky-Way template](https://github.com/ttomczak3/Milky-Way) provided an excellent base and inspiration.

## The Customization

My first move was custom particles using the [astro-particles](https://github.com/tsparticles/astro) library
from there using the example from [the readme](https://github.com/tsparticles/astro#how-to-use)
I tried to imitate snow using the original color palette and wound up using the following particle settings

```json
particles: {
    color: {
        value: "#fdebf3",
    },
    move: {
        enable: true,
        direction: "bottom",
        outModes: "out",
        speed: 2,
    },
    number: {
        density: {
            enable: true,
            area: 800,
        },
        value: 400,
    },
    opacity: {
        value: 0.7,
    },
    shape: {
        type: "circle",
    },
    size: {
        value: 10,
    },
    wobble: {
        enable: true,
        distance: 10,
        speed: 10,
    },
    zIndex: {
        value: { min: -1, max: 100 },
    },
};
```

the particles combined with some minor css changes allowed me to make the Homepage.
To wrap things up I used tailwindcss to make the ui work across various screen sizes
and to make things a bit more defined.

<Image
  src={frontmatter.image.url}
  alt={frontmatter.image.alt}
  inferSize
  densities={[0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0]}
  class="w-5/6 mx-auto"
/>
